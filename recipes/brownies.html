    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa powder</strong>: Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate brownies!</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the brownies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Walnuts</strong>: Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.</li>

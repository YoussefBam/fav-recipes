# fav-recipes
This current project will highlight my favorite foods and it's associated recipes.
I learned how to use git to add commits to github and i solidified my knowledge in lists.
I also learned about the height and width of images and the strong and the em. 
Now i'd rather use the terminal to mkdir , mv, rm than doing it manually.
